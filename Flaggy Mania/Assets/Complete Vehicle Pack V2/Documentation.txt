Thank you for purchasing Complete Vehicle Pack V2!

The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into a scene.
Every car has the wheels separated, with centered pivot points. The wheels have wheel collider components atached to them, but will require further tweaking in order to work properly.

The naming convention uses the ".L" and ".R" suffixes for wheels on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of the vehicle uses the name "Wheel_Front.R"

Some of the vehicles have moving parts, such as propellers, trunk doors, truck cabins, even a satellite dish. It's easy to edit their position, by selecting them from the objects hierarchy.

There are a total of 39 prefabs, 36 of which are vehicles, 2 of which are cargo boxes for the trucks and pick-ups. An external trunk was added to attach to the vehicles as you please.

The helicopters have idle animations for the propellers, and the news van has an idle animation for it's satellite dish.
